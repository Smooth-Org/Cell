-- ============================================================
-- AURA CONTAINER FACTORY (DF.AuraContainer)
--
-- One shared factory for WoW 12.1's Blizzard-driven AuraContainer / AuraButton
-- widgets. Every aura-displaying feature (buff/debuff rows, defensives, dispel,
-- Aura Designer, ...) routes through this module instead of talking to the
-- container API directly, so the weekly 12.1 PTR churn — and the PTR-4
-- CustomAuraContainer -> ManagedAuraContainer swap (auto-buttons + Spell-ID /
-- dispel / stealable / max-duration filters + sort) — is ONE internal rewrite
-- behind a stable interface, not four. Mirrors the DF.Border precedent.
--
-- THE MODEL (12.1): reading aura data in Lua is sealed; DISPLAY is not. The addon
-- CREATES + STYLES the buttons; Blizzard's secure code FILLS + DRIVES them. This
-- module owns the MECHANISM (the addon-owned-button construction dance, the
-- secret-safe inbound setters, the two shapes: "row" and "overlay"); each feature
-- owns the POLICY (which filter, layout, config keys). The factory never reads
-- aura data, never loops-and-draws — it configures and hands off.
--
-- PUBLIC API:  († = provided, no internal consumer yet -- see the note below)
--   DF.AuraContainer.IsSupported()       -- 12.1+ widget types exist (version gate)
--   DF.AuraContainer.HasSpellFilter() †  -- PTR-4: per-Spell-ID filter available
--   DF.AuraContainer.HasSort()        †  -- PTR-4: sort rule/direction available
--   local h = DF.AuraContainer:Create(parent, config)  -- nil if unsupported
--   h:SetUnit(unit) / h:SetShown(b) / h:Enable() / h:Disable()
--   h:ApplyStyle(style) -- in-place cosmetic restyle (no teardown)
--   h:ApplyTuning(tuning) -- in-place max/sort/candidateFilters mutate (no teardown;
--                            OOC-only, defers to regen in combat). REPLACES all three keys.
--   h:SetFilter(filter) † -- structural (rebuild)
--   h:Rebuild(config)      -- structural rebuild (max / region toggles / frozen opts); a
--                             table REPLACES the config wholesale (callers pass complete configs)
--   h:Refresh() -- force a re-scan (Hide/Show bounce; for dynamic-unit consumers)
--   h:GetFrame() -- the plain positioning frame DF anchors (SetPoint/SetSize on it)
--   h:Destroy()
--
-- † HasSpellFilter / HasSort / SetFilter have no internal caller. An earlier review
--   deferred the question to container Wave 1; W1 has since shipped, and it used
--   SetSort / _getConfig / _getAnchorFrame / _layoutSlots but not these three. They
--   stay as published API — capability probes are the natural shape for a later wave
--   to gate on, and they are one-liners over IsSupported(). Recorded here so the next
--   dead-code sweep gets the answer instead of re-raising the question.
--
-- GOTCHAS baked in (12.1.0 @ 68569 — the PTR-4 API; validated in-game via DF_AuraLab):
--   1. Addons NO LONGER create AuraButtons (AddAuraFrame/AddAuraFramesFromTemplate removed).
--      The container creates + anchors its own buttons; we register AuraGroups (row) /
--      AuraSlots (overlay) and Blizzard calls our initializeFrame per button to style it.
--   2. Order: SetUnit -> AddAuraGroup/AddAuraSlot(each, initializeFrame) -> SetEnabled LAST.
--      SetEnabled gates aura-event registration (IsVisible() and IsEnabled()).
--   3. container:UpdateAllAuras() is now an addon-callable dirty-mark (the real refresh).
--   4. In initializeFrame: build FRESH regions as children of the button. NEVER SetParent
--      an existing scripted widget onto a button (forbidden-aspect inheritance blocks it).
--   5. SetDurationText textColorCurve is NOT addon-reachable on 68569 (live-tested: Blizzard
--      forwards the curve without the required `property`, and DurationTextBinding is private).
--      Colour-by-time = discrete BUCKETS via the duration formatter (|c escapes) — P2.
--      Stacks formatters are FORBIDDEN outright (secret trap — see bindNative).
--   6. Animation drivers do NOT run inside the button subtree: onUpdateMode=disabled
--      propagates, so an OnUpdate/AnimationGroup on a descendant is installed but never
--      ticks (verified in-game — SetScript/Play merely don't error). Host the driver
--      OUTSIDE the subtree (e.g. UIParent) and drive our own textures by reference — see
--      DF.Border ensureDriver (secretRect -> UIParent). Expiry-TRIGGERED anim is separately
--      dead (needs the sealed timer).
--   7. Cannot read IsShown / spellId / expirationTime / dispelName / presence — all secret.
--      Never branch on them. Filtering is Blizzard-side (filterString + candidateFilters).
--   8. Group topology is add-only: no RemoveAuraGroup/Slot; a filterString change = recreate
--      the container. candidateFilters / sortMethod / maxFrameCount / layout are live setters.

-- EDIT-MODE DEAFENING — the per-container opt-out
-- ============================================================
-- 12.1 build 68569 folded CustomAuraContainer onto the (new in that build)
-- ManagedAuraContainer, and with it our containers inherited Edit Mode's sample
-- data. On 68412 CustomAuraContainerPrivateMixin:ParseAllAuras called
-- C_UnitAuras.GetUnitAuras HARD-CODED, so custom containers were immune by
-- construction; now parsing runs through GetAuraSources(), which returns
-- AuraContainerAuraSourceLists.EditMode whenever the container's own flag is set.
-- Exactly ONE thing sets that flag — the container's own handler:
--
--     ManagedAuraContainerPrivateMixin:OnAuraDataProviderSwitch(useRealDataProvider)
--         self:SetUseEditModeSource(not useRealDataProvider)
--
-- The normal source reads C_UnitAuras DIRECTLY — it does NOT go through the
-- swapped AuraUtil provider — so a container that never HEARS the switch keeps
-- rendering live auras with Edit Mode open. Probe 33 already proved this from the
-- other side ("born-deaf containers": one built after a switch stays on the
-- previous source); the old "the swap is below the container layer" reading was
-- wrong for this build.
--
-- ☠ WHY IT GOES IN THE BUILD PATH: AURA_DATA_PROVIDER_SWITCH is a STATIC event —
-- registered once in AuraContainerPrivateMixin:OnLoad_Intrinsic, and
-- UpdateEventRegistrations only ever churns the DYNAMIC lists — so an unregister
-- sticks for the life of that frame. But only THAT frame: every structural
-- rebuild creates a brand new container, which registers it afresh. A one-shot
-- deafening expires silently, which is the likeliest reason probe 34 read as a
-- false negative. So it is re-applied on every build, at the creation site.
--
-- DF's own test mode RIDES this event (the provider bounce is how the curated
-- preview gets its data), so this is a TOGGLE, not a permanent unregister:
-- containers are born deaf, and are born hearing while _testMode is on.
local PROVIDER_EVENT = "AURA_DATA_PROVIDER_SWITCH"

-- AuraContainer._providerDeafOK: nil = not yet probed, true/false = the live
-- client's answer. The container is a forbidden-table object; base widget methods
-- ARE reachable (we already call SetScale / SetPoint / SetMouseClickEnabled on
-- it), but the event methods have to be proven at runtime rather than assumed.
-- The dangerous case is a SILENT refusal — the unregister does not error but the
-- event stays registered — which would leave every row showing sample icons, so
-- it is tested for explicitly. Anything short of a proven success keeps the old
-- hide-the-rows guard (see EDIT-MODE GUARD below) as the fallback.

-- ============================================================
-- PER-CONTAINER SAMPLE SOURCE — capability probe
-- ============================================================
-- ☠ PROBE ONLY. It records what the live client allows and changes NO behaviour.
-- Do not wire anything to the result until it has come back true in game.
--
-- The prize, if it works: SetUseEditModeSource is the ONE thing that decides
-- whether a container reads Edit Mode's sample auras --
--
--     ManagedAuraContainerPrivateMixin:OnAuraDataProviderSwitch(useRealDataProvider)
--         self:SetUseEditModeSource(not useRealDataProvider)
--
-- -- and it is per CONTAINER. Today test mode reaches it the only way we know
-- works: C_UnitAuras.SwitchAuraDataProvider, which is GLOBAL, so it drags every
-- other aura container in the client onto sample data with us. That is what makes
-- Blizzard's buff and debuff frames misbehave under Unlock Mode, and in the other
-- direction what costs Blizzard's Edit Mode preview its sample auras when we reset
-- the provider to rescue our own rows. Calling the setter ourselves would remove the
-- cause of both instead of living with them.
--
-- ⚠ Hiding Blizzard's frames for the duration was tried and REVERTED: they come back
-- on sample data for another 5-10s after test mode exits, so the churn was only moved
-- to a worse moment, and the cost was a real risk of stranding them hidden.
--
-- Why it is probed rather than assumed, either way:
--   * It is a PRIVATE-mixin method, not a base widget method. Base methods are
--     reachable on these forbidden-table objects (we already call SetScale,
--     SetPoint, SetMouseClickEnabled); private ones are usually not exposed to
--     addon code at all, so the field may simply be nil.
--   * The container carries a forbidden aspect from birth, and we have already been
--     refused on this exact object: UnregisterEvent gives "Function call not
--     permitted on forbidden aspect 'EventRegistrations'" (proven in game, 68914).
--     A setter that swings the container's data source is at least as likely gated.
--
-- ⚠ Only ever called while test mode is ON, and only with `true`. That is the value
-- the global switch is about to force on this container anyway, so a SUCCESS is a
-- no-op rather than a behaviour change we did not intend — and a refusal is the
-- answer we came for. Never probe with `false`: on a container that had legitimately
-- heard the switch that WOULD change what renders.

-- test-mode duration so the edit-mode guard (ensureProviderWatch) never hides our
-- own preview. The switch is GLOBAL — Blizzard's own aura displays show sample data
-- while DF test mode is open (restored on exit; accepted trade-off).
-- Coalesced provider bounce (reset -> switch). Only the EVENT flips a container
-- onto the sample source, and a container built AFTER a switch never heard it —

    -- reached from the other in place.
    --
    -- But that only ever applied to the handles that RENDER the preview. Live
    -- frames are hidden for the whole session by SetTestModeStateDrivers, so
    -- rebuilding them into test shape and back rendered nothing either way.

    -- ☠ DO NOT re-justify this with "live containers are built deaf". They are
    -- NOT. setContainerProviderDeaf (top of this file) is a one-shot CAPABILITY
    -- PROBE that no-ops after its first call -- UnregisterEvent on the container
    -- is refused by design (ForbiddenAspect.EventRegistrations, answered in game
    -- on 68914). Every container hears AURA_DATA_PROVIDER_SWITCH, so a live
    -- handle left standing does follow the bounce onto the sample provider.
    -- It is HIDDEN, so that is invisible -- with one pre-existing exception:
    -- the [combat] state driver reveals live frames the instant combat starts
    -- (see TestMode.lua's note), and those rows then show sample auras. That
    -- edge was already wrong before this change (it showed curated TEST paint on
    -- live frames instead), so this neither introduces nor fixes it. Unverified
    -- in game; if it matters, the fix is to re-point live handles on reveal, not
    -- to rebuild every one of them on both transitions.
    --
    -- ⚠ It is NOT true that the entry pass can be dropped altogether -- that was
    -- the first read of the trace and it is wrong. The test frame pool is created
    -- once (testFramePoolInitialized) and its frames are only HIDDEN on exit, so
    -- from the SECOND entry onward the test handles already exist here and do
    -- need the rebuild. On the very first entry this loop legitimately does
    -- nothing: the pool is built after SetTestMode returns and those handles are
    -- born in test shape (build() reads _testMode itself).
    -- ☠ LOAD-BEARING INVARIANT, and it is not local to this function: build() picks
    -- its SHAPE from the GLOBAL AuraContainer._testMode (the `local testMode` read,
    -- and SetEnabled's `not testMode`), while the rebuild below is keyed on the
    -- PER-HANDLE flag. They must agree. A handle built while _testMode is on but
    -- whose _testFrame is false would be born test-shaped and never rebuilt out of
    -- it — groups can never be removed, so that container is stuck showing curated
    -- paint on a live frame forever. What guarantees they agree is that NO live
    -- handle is ever built during test mode, enforced by the UseFactoryFor* gates
    -- in Features/Auras.lua, Frames/Icons.lua and AuraDesigner (each excludes
    -- DF.testMode/raidTestMode). Before this became conditional the unconditional
    -- rebuild made the invariant unnecessary. The asymmetry is what makes it worth

    -- POSITIVE only costs one extra rebuild.

-- ★ CANONICAL FILTER STRINGS — a free parse win, and the reason is engine-side.
-- ManagedAuraContainerPrivateMixin:RebuildAuraParseFilters groups every group and slot by
-- filter string and queries each DISTINCT string once, and Blizzard's own comment is

-- is the one saving that cannot be had per consumer -- it needs GLOBAL string discipline,
-- so it goes at the chokepoint every record passes through rather than in each builder.

-- Sort is by BARE token, with a token's negation immediately after it, so "!X" can never
-- drift away from "X". Duplicate tokens collapse. Memoised on the input string: the same
-- handful of strings recur on every rebuild across every frame.
-- ⚠ Order-independence is Blizzard's model (AuraUtil tokenises on "|" and space into a

--     5  DURATION         duration text / spell name / DISPEL_SYMBOL
--     6  STACK            top-most text
--     7  PANDEMIC_BORDER  a ring tracing the edge, so it must clear everything
--
-- ⚠ DISPEL_SYMBOL DELIBERATELY SHARES RUNG 5 with the duration text rather than taking
-- its own. The ladder is depth-limited (see the budget below) and the two are the only
-- pair with no ordering requirement between them. Where they overlap — a centred
-- duration text under a centred glyph — draw order falls to creation order, and the
-- symbol holder is created after the duration holder in this same pass, so the glyph
-- still lands on top exactly as it did when it had its own rung.
--
-- ☠☠ HOW THIS BROKE, so it is not repeated. The 2026-08-07 z-order squash collapsed
-- this ladder from 12/13/13/14/15 to 1/2/3/4/5 and dropped the icon border to
-- DF.Border's shared default of +2 — but `Features/Pandemic.lua` computed its own
-- absolute levels (9 for TINT, 15 for BORDER) against the OLD numbers and was not
-- touched. Two consequences, both shipped:
--   * the dispel ring sat at +1 UNDER a +2 border and was invisible (Krathe, 2026-08-08);
--   * the pandemic TINT at +9 rose ABOVE the whole 1-5 ladder, washing over the timer
--     and stack count again — the exact regression 2026-08-05 had already fixed.
-- ⇒ **Pandemic.lua now reads THIS table.** Do not reintroduce a second set of numbers.
--
-- ☠ BORDER IS PASSED EXPLICITLY, never left to DF.Border's default. The default is +2
-- and is documented as wrong for any parent that stacks things over its own rect —
-- which is exactly what these holders do. Leaving it default is what buried the ring,
-- and it also leaves no room BELOW the border for the tint.
--
-- ☠☠ THE BUDGET, AND WHY THIS LADDER CANNOT SIMPLY GROW. Measured from the CONTAINER:
-- container +0, button +2, so the holders occupy container +4..+9 and a row is **9
-- levels thick**. `AuraDesigner/Factory.ALERT_ROW_LIFT` lifts an alert clear of a whole
-- row, so it must exceed that — and an indicator PLUS its alert has to stay inside one
-- user-facing band, which are 20 apart. 10 + 9 = 19 fits, with one level of slack.
-- ⇒ **Adding a rung here costs two levels of that budget and breaks it at 21.** If a new
-- region needs a level, share an existing rung (as DISPEL_SYMBOL does) or re-derive
-- ALERT_ROW_LIFT and the band spacing together. Confirm with `/df debug zorder`.

-- NOTE (step 1): reconcile with DF's legacy center-growth / pixel-perfect handling so
-- buff/debuff rows lay out pixel-identically to today. This baseline covers the common
-- cases. (The note named Features/Auras.lua RepositionCenterGrowthIcons as the thing
-- to reconcile against; no such function exists any more, in either addon, so the
-- comparison has to be made against rendered output rather than against that source.)
-- ============================================================
local AXIS = {
    RIGHT = { x = 1, y = 0 }, LEFT = { x = -1, y = 0 },
    UP    = { x = 0, y = 1 }, DOWN = { x = 0, y = -1 },
}

-- DF growth token -> AnchorUtil.FlowDirection member name.
local FLOW_NAME = { RIGHT = "Right", LEFT = "Left", UP = "Up", DOWN = "Down" }

-- Translate DF's layout vocabulary (anchor/growth/wrap/size/spacing/offset/scale) onto
-- the container's NATIVE flow layout. Every setter here is a LIVE mutator (each just
-- MarkDirty(AuraFrameLayout)-s), so this re-applies on a slider drag without a rebuild.
--
-- Geometry model (from Blizzard_CustomAuraContainer.lua + AnchorUtil flow layout):
--   * The container AUTO-RESIZES to its content (OnLayoutComplete -> SetSize) and its
--     buttons anchor from the container's layoutAnchorPoint corner. So we anchor the
--     CONTAINER by that same corner to the unit frame's matching corner + the user's
--     offsets — the row then grows away from the frame corner exactly like the legacy
--     hand-anchored rows (whose first icon sat at frame-anchor + offset).
--   * Wrap: the flow is row-primary; rowWidth caps a row. wrap N icons ->
--     rowWidth = N*sizeX + (N-1)*spacingX (container-local units).
--   * Vertical-primary growth (UP_*/DOWN_*): the flow can't run column-primary, so we
--     force one icon per row (rowWidth = sizeX) and the v-direction stacks the column.
--     A vertical wrap COUNT is not expressible — single column (legacy parity gap, GUI
--     note in P2 polish).
--   * CENTER growth IS expressible and IS implemented — see the `if out.center` branch
--     in resolveGrowthLayout below, which computes flowAnchor/pinPoint/pinX/pinY for
--     both the vertical and horizontal centred stacks, and the paragraph above it that
--     explains the box-pin approach. (This line used to say CENTER "falls back to
--     Right": written before that branch existed, and left behind when it landed.)
--   * Scale: applied to the container itself — buttons, fonts, borders and spacing all
--     render at row scale (the legacy defensive stride model; buff rows historically
--     didn't scale the spacing term — the flow can't express that split, and scaling
--     spacing uniformly is the more consistent behaviour anyway).
-- Resolve config.layout into flow parameters: flow direction names, the corner the
-- flow fills from (flowAnchor), and how the container box pins to the user's anchor
-- point (pinPoint + pinX/pinY offsets).
--
-- CENTER growth ("Direction: Center" — legacy did this with a second positioning pass
-- in Icons.lua; that helper no longer exists, so this is the only implementation):
-- the native flow has no centering
-- concept, but the container SELF-SIZES to content each layout pass (secret SetSize,
-- Blizzard_CustomAuraContainer.lua:738) — so fill the box from a fixed corner and
-- pin the box's centre-of-edge to the user's anchor point; the render then keeps
-- the row centred as icons come and go, in combat, with zero reads. pinX/pinY fold
-- in the icon-anchor offset the legacy pass produced (legacy anchored each ICON's
-- own `anchor` point at the target; the box pin is edge-based), so the common
-- single-row case lands where the legacy pass put it. Multi-row blocks fill from
-- the box corner (flow order) rather than centring each row individually —
-- accepted approximation, the flow owns button placement.

-- PIXEL PERFECT (container edition). The legacy aura icons kept three PP
-- invariants the container port initially lost:
--   1. border thickness snapped in the RENDER space (legacy ran scale=1.0 and

--      fold the scale — DF.Border spec.renderScale / Border:SnapThickness);
--   2. icon size / spacing quantized to whole physical pixels (fractional
--      strides accumulate across a row — adjacent icons rendered visibly
--      different borders);
--   3. the render origin nudged onto the physical pixel grid (legacy:
--      SnapPointToPixelGrid per icon placement).
-- Buttons here are anchored by Blizzard's secure flow layout (secret offsets,
-- §20c) so a per-button snap is impossible — instead the CONTAINER'S pin offset
-- is adjusted arithmetically from the anchor frame's rect (a plain DF frame,
-- readable; the container's own rect is secret-derived and never read). With the
-- pin corner on-grid and every stride whole-pixel, each button lands on-grid.
-- CENTER growth stays best-effort: its pin is a centre-of-edge, so an odd total
-- row width still straddles by half a pixel.

-- Per-group layout options (stride/spacing). groupSpacing stays 0: the flow
-- advances its cursor by width + elementSpacing after EVERY element — including
-- a group's last — and then adds groupSpacing ON TOP before the next group
-- (AnchorUtil.ApplyFlowLayout), so any non-zero value renders group boundaries
-- at spacing + groupSpacing. The original gap = spacing DOUBLED the gap between
-- filter blocks on multi-filter rows (and between every button of the per-slot
-- test rows) — live-reported. With 0, groups still continue on the same row,
-- uniformly spaced. (68914 rewrote the flow but kept these additive semantics.)
--
-- 68914 also RENAMED the keys: elementSpacingX/elementSpacingY/gapX ->
-- elementSpacing (primary axis) / lineSpacing (cross axis, applied on wrap) /
-- groupSpacing. Unknown keys are silently dropped, never rejected
-- (CopyAndValidateInboundTable merges over defaults and validates known keys
-- only), so we carry BOTH families and each build reads its own.
-- A per-record style that scales its buttons needs the GROUP's layout cell scaled to
-- match, or the bigger icon overlaps its neighbour: the button size and the flow's
-- reserved cell are separate things. Returns the base table unchanged when there is
-- nothing to scale, so callers can pass the result straight through.
-- The flow-layout cell for ONE record: the container's shared cell plus whatever
-- that record overrides. Three things can move it:
--
--   * scale — the important-debuff step. A bigger BUTTON does not widen its cell, so
--     without this the scaled icon overlaps its neighbour.
--   * size — a member carrying its own icon size (Aura Designer group members each do).
--   * layoutIndex — ☠ WHERE MEMBER ORDER COMES FROM. Blizzard sorts the flow groups by
--     layoutIndex and falls back to registration order only as a tiebreak
--     (SortFlowLayoutDescriptions / GetEffectiveFlowLayoutIndex in
--     Blizzard_CustomAuraContainer.lua). Setting it explicitly is what makes an AD group
--     render in the order the user arranged it, instead of in whatever order we happened
--     to register the members — and it keeps that order as members come and go, because
--     an empty group contributes no elements and no spacing.

-- ============================================================
-- ============================================================
-- BACKENDS
-- A backend PRODUCES slots (from a data source) and hands each to the layout half via
-- handle:_acceptSlot; the handle owns positioning/styling/lifecycle and routes
-- SetUnit/Enable/Refresh/teardown to the active backend. The public API is unchanged.
--
-- NativeBackend — the 68569 CustomAuraContainer path. The CONTAINER creates + anchors its
-- OWN buttons (AddAuraFrame is removed): we register one AuraGroup per filter (row mode)
-- or one AuraSlot per filter (overlay mode), and Blizzard invokes our initializeFrame
-- per button (in lazy batches of 10) to style it. isNativeSlots = true. Row layout is the
-- container's flow layout (applyContainerLayout translates onto SetFlowLayout*); overlay slots are
-- addon-anchored via the button AddAuraSlot returns.
--
-- Each backend owns its OWN plain container: insecure CreateFrame is combat-legal for the
-- aura pipeline (taint.log-proven; the earlier freeze was unrelated secret-value compares,
-- since fixed). One container per consumer = one flow layout per row (independent
-- positioning) and a trivial recreate-on-structural-change teardown. The container is
-- STANDING: built once from config, then Blizzard drives it — no per-UNIT_AURA touches.
-- ============================================================
-- MISSING mode: gap between the container's pinned right edge and the clip window,
-- and the badge's inset from the container's TOPLEFT — the two cancel so the empty
-- state parks the badge exactly on the window. Also the extra cell width beyond the
-- badge, so the pushed badge clears the window with margin.

-- 12.1; padding defaults are all 0 so the floor always wins when empty). The
-- parked missing badge rides the container's TOPLEFT = pin - selfWidth, so that
-- 1 unit re-entered the badge position as a FRACTIONAL-pixel drift (1 unit is
-- rarely a whole physical pixel) — field-caught as the missing badge's border
-- rendering thicker on one side under pixel perfect, surviving every other
-- quantization fix. Compensate it EXACTLY in the badge offset; the push's

-- ★ PER-FRAME POOL ROTATION — why every frame used to show the same two icons.
--
-- The pools hold ten entries but a preview only draws as many as the count slider
-- allows, and every container asked for indices 1..N, so all five party frames drew
-- entries 1 and 2 and the other eight were never seen by anyone. Rotating the START
-- per frame shows the whole pool at once across a group.
--
-- ☠ DETERMINISTIC, NOT RANDOM. `math.random` here would re-roll on every repaint, and
-- the preview repaints on any restyle — icons would churn while you drag a slider,
-- which reads as a rendering bug. The unit token is stable for a frame's whole life
-- (TestFramePool stamps "raid7"/"party2"/"player"), so it is the seed.
--
-- ☠ THE STEP IS THE ICON COUNT, NOT 1 AND NOT A FIXED PRIME. Stepping by 1 makes
-- neighbours overlap almost entirely (frames showing 1-2, 2-3, 3-4…). Stepping by the
-- COUNT tiles the pool instead: at 2 icons, five party frames take 1-2, 3-4, 5-6, 7-8,
-- 9-10 — the whole pool on screen at once, nothing repeated. A fixed prime was tried
-- first and measured worse (8 of 10 entries, 2 repeats), because coprime-ness spreads
-- the STARTS without stopping the windows overlapping.
--
-- The fallback matters though: stepping by the count degenerates when the count divides
-- the pool too evenly — at 5 icons over 10 entries the offsets are 0,5,0,5,0 and every
-- other frame is identical, which is the exact complaint this is fixing. distinct starts
-- = poolSize / gcd(step, poolSize), so when that drops below 4 fall back to 7, which is
-- coprime with both live pool sizes (10 rows, 4 defensives) and therefore always spreads.
--
-- ⚠ NEVER rotates config.testEntries. Those are the Aura Designer's OWN configured
-- spells for that indicator, not a sample pool — rotating them would preview a spell
-- the user did not choose.

--   swipe -> Cooldown:SetCooldownFromDurationObject
--   text  -> our own DurationTextBinding, options mirrored 1:1 from bindNative

-- ============================================================
-- OWN-FRAME PREVIEW — test mode without the global sample provider
-- ============================================================
-- ☠ WHY THIS EXISTS. The engine has no per-container sample source: the only lever
-- is C_UnitAuras.SwitchAuraDataProvider, which fires the client-wide
-- AURA_DATA_PROVIDER_SWITCH that EVERY aura container registers for intrinsically
-- (Blizzard_AuraContainer.lua). Flipping it for our preview therefore fills every
-- OTHER addon's containers with sample icons too — nameplates, unit frames, the lot.
-- The per-container flag exists (useEditModeSource) but its setter is on the private
-- mixin, and none of the 19 public container methods touches the data source, so it
-- can be neither set for us nor suppressed for anyone else.
--
-- ★ AND THE ENGINE'S SAMPLE DATA WAS NEVER THE POINT. Its auras carry no spell IDs,
-- durations or raid flags (see the per-slot-group header), so every icon, name,
-- count and timer in the preview was ALREADY painted by _paintTestSlot from our own
-- TestData. The switch bought exactly one thing: presence — engine-created buttons
-- to paint onto. Supplying those ourselves costs nothing and drops the global blast
-- radius entirely.
--
-- ★ THE SEAMS ARE ALL PRE-EXISTING, which is what keeps this honest:
--   * _acceptSlot   — registers into self.buttons and runs the SAME styleButton_regions
--                     the engine path runs, so styling cannot diverge.
--   * _paintTestSlot— the SAME painter, untouched. The AD editor canvas has painted
--                     plain CreateFrame("Frame") slots this way since it shipped.
--   * layoutRow     — the SAME positioner live uses off config.layout, including the
--                     pixel-perfect snap. No second layout implementation exists to
--                     drift, which is the failure mode this whole design is avoiding.
-- Everything downstream (ApplyStyle, the test ticker, teardown) already iterates
-- self.buttons and does not care where a button came from.
--
-- ⚠ Frames are pooled per handle and REUSED across rebuilds — creating fresh ones per
-- rebuild is what made the engine route allocate ~530 MB over four test toggles.
-- ☠ PLACEMENT MUST COME FROM THE ENGINE'S FLOW, NOT layoutRow.
-- First cut positioned the preview with layoutRow and the commit claimed that was
-- "the same positioner live uses". It is not: NATIVE rows are placed by the
-- container's own AnchorUtil flow (see applyContainerLayout), and layoutRow is the
-- legacy fallback's maths. Two implementations off one config is exactly the
-- preview/live divergence this whole design exists to avoid, and it would have
-- shown up first on the awkward cases (CENTER growth, wrapping, UP/LEFT growth,
-- the duration-strip reservation that shifts row stride).
--
-- So the preview drives AnchorUtil.CreateFlowLayout() -- the SAME public flow the
-- container uses -- configured from the SAME resolveGrowthLayout / buildGroupLayout
-- / stripReservation derivations applyContainerLayout feeds it. The box frame stands
-- in for the container: pinned with the identical pin point, offsets, pp snap and
-- scale, so the flow lays out in the same space.
--
-- Returns false on any doubt (no AnchorUtil, an enum that will not resolve, Apply
-- throwing) and the caller falls back to layoutRow — a slightly-off preview beats no
-- preview, and this must never be the thing that breaks test mode.

-- Build the per-button styling callback Blizzard invokes (securecallfunction) for each
-- container-created button, in lazy batches of 10 as auras appear -- so this can fire long
-- after build, including mid-combat. Whole body is pcall-wrapped (an unguarded fault would
-- abort Blizzard's batch creation); the gen token drops a callback from a torn-down or
-- rebuilt container; a running counter mirrors the old per-index slot id (batches append,
-- so indices stay contiguous -- ipairs(self.buttons) in ApplyStyle/layoutRow still holds).
-- PER-RECORD STYLE (important-debuff highlight). A row's buttons are all styled from
-- the container-wide config, which is right for everything except a group that exists
-- BECAUSE its auras are a distinct class. Records can carry `style` and every button in
-- that group gets it — unconditionally, because membership already IS the predicate.
-- Nothing here reads aura data; we never learn which aura a button holds.
--
-- ⚠ Runs AFTER _acceptSlot, which sized the button from the shared layout — the scale
-- below deliberately overrides that. The group's own layout cell is widened to match at
-- AddAuraGroup (see the record loop), or the bigger button would overlap its neighbour.
--
-- Regions are created ONCE and updated in place: initializeFrame re-runs on restyle, and
-- ApplyStyle re-runs it without teardown. Never Show/Hide a region a native setter owns;
-- these are DF-owned textures on the button, so plain SetShown is fine.
-- NOTE: assigns the local forward-declared above _acceptSlot (which calls this on every
-- restyle). Deliberately NOT `local function` — that would shadow the forward local and
-- leave _acceptSlot calling a nil global.
-- ============================================================
-- PER-RECORD CONFIG VIEW  — full per-member styling in ONE container
-- ============================================================
-- A record that carries `button` (a complete style table) is styled by the SHARED
-- styler against a config view of its own, rather than by a bespoke override list.
-- That is what makes per-member styling total instead of partial: everything
-- styleButton_regions can express, a member can express, automatically and forever
-- — including anything added to it later.
--
-- ⚠ Complete by construction, not by hopeful copying. styleButton_regions reads
-- exactly five config fields: style, layout, mode, unit, adBorderAnim. The first
-- two are what a member overrides; the rest are container-wide. So an __index
-- proxy over the real config, with those two swapped, is the whole substitution —
-- a hand-built partial copy would silently drift the moment the styler reads
-- something new.
--
-- Memoised on the record: these are rebuilt on every restyle of every button, and
-- allocating a table per button per pass would churn the hot path.

-- outside instanced content or a duel partner). RENDER-SIDE ONLY: hides the
-- plain anchor frame (combat-safe), never touches the secure enabled state —
-- that stays owned by SetShown/_applyEnabled. Composes with consumer intent:
-- a consumer-hidden handle stays hidden when the gate lifts. Fail-safe on any
-- doubt (secret value, pcall failure, missing unit): SHOW — a wrongly-hidden
-- row is worse than one garbage frame. Always recomputes (no vulnerable
-- early-out) so a handle rebuilt onto a non-vulnerable filter clears a stale
-- hidden flag instead of staying hidden forever.
-- ☠ THE GATE FAILS OPEN AND THE ENGINE DOES NOT RE-PARSE ON ITS OWN.
-- A non-assistable unit renders EVERY helpful aura (includeSpellIDs is skipped
-- wholesale — see filterVulnerableToIdentityGate). The engine only re-parses when
-- an aura CHANGES, so once assistability comes back the unfiltered pool just STAYS.
-- That is precisely why the only workarounds users ever found (toggling test mode,
-- toggling any filter) were pure REBUILDS.
--
-- Live repro, 100%, Krathe 2026-08-12: watch an in-game cinematic. It flips
-- UNIT_FACTION so you stop being assistable, every filtered buff pool opens up, and
-- it persists after the cinematic ends. 12.1 forces one on first login — which is
-- what produced the "unfiltered buffs after upgrading" reports that were chased as a
-- v4→v5 migration bug for two days. It is not a migration bug and it hits clean v5
-- profiles too. Corroborated on the addon dev Discord (plusmouse): "UNIT_FACTION
-- seems to change, so the unit ceases to be assistable".
--
-- ☠ We ALREADY registered UNIT_FACTION (see idGateWatch) — the event was never the
-- gap. The sweep just recomputed a hide flag and never re-parsed.
--
-- Bounce on the false→true EDGE only. A bounce every sweep would re-parse every
-- vulnerable handle on every roster/name/phase event. nil (first computation) is not
-- an edge — but a container built DURING a cinematic records false, so the exit edge
-- still fires, which is the first-login case.
-- Re-entrancy: the flag is stored BEFORE Refresh(), so a re-entrant gate pass sees
-- true and cannot bounce again.
-- CINEMATIC LATCH (see the cineWatch block at the bottom of the file). While set,
-- the handle stays hidden through _applyVisibility's existing composition -- the
-- same combat-safe render-side lever the identity gate uses. The latch exists so
-- the fail-open parse a cinematic leaves behind is never SEEN: the frames come
-- back only after the recovery re-parse below has run.

-- created (AddAuraGroup allocates in batches of FrameCreationBatchSize) -- permanently,
-- for the session. That is invisible in a set-and-forget profile and unbounded for
-- anyone whose config churns: AutoProfiles flipping on zone/combat transitions, preset
-- toggling in the Designer, profile switching.

-- fresh, so A -> B -> A costs one container total rather than three.

-- file has shipped before. The consumers already maintain exact structural sigs
-- (rowStructSig, placedStructSig, ...) whose entire definition is "changing this needs
-- a new container". That is the parking key, by construction. No key supplied = no
-- parking, so an unwired call site keeps today's behaviour exactly.

-- (see AuraContainer.SetTestMode). The backend owns the container + slot
-- production; the handle owns styling/layout/lifecycle.

-- Z-ORDER — frame level + frame strata, from self.config. Level: legacy renders host aura
-- icons ABOVE contentOverlay (parent+25, name/health text). Raising self.frame raises the
-- whole subtree — the native container + AuraButtons + their holders are all descendants with
-- relative levels (Blizzard sets no fixed levels). Default +40 = legacy buff-icon level; the
-- defensive row passes +51 (= contentOverlay+26). Strata picks the BAND; the level offset only
-- orders WITHIN a band.
--
-- ★ Called from Create AND from every _build. It MUST run on rebuild: Rebuild() swaps
-- self.config and calls _build WITHOUT recreating self.frame, so a config whose z-order keys
-- changed would otherwise keep whatever Create stamped — which is why a struct-sig change to
-- Frame Level did not take effect until a reload. Recomputing is a couple of setter calls, so
-- an unconditional call per build costs nothing.
--
-- Strata is deliberately OPT-IN. Calling SetFrameStrata PINS a frame: it stops tracking the
-- parent's band. Containers that never set frameStrata are therefore left untouched and keep
-- inheriting, exactly as before. Only once an explicit strata has been applied do we re-assert
-- the parent's band on the way back to Inherit (there is no "unset" to write) — tracked by
-- _strataPinned so the restore happens once and never on a container that never opted in.
-- Public form: pass the INCOMING config to apply a z-order that self.config does not carry yet.
-- The buff/debuff/defensive row drivers need this. They keep frameLevelOffset out of their sigs
-- on purpose (a level change is not structural and must not force a Rebuild), so a level-only
-- change never reaches _build — the driver applies it directly against the new cfg instead.

-- ============================================================
-- EDIT-MODE GUARD (shared)
-- ============================================================
-- Blizzard Edit Mode flips every aura container onto its sample-data source. We
-- cannot stop OUR containers hearing that switch -- the container carries the
-- EventRegistrations forbidden aspect from birth, so UnregisterEvent is refused
-- (see EDIT-MODE DEAFENING near the top of this file). But we do not need to.
--
-- ★ PRIMARY: hand the real provider straight back. C_UnitAuras.ResetAuraDataProvider
-- is public and unrestricted (no HasRestrictions in the generated docs; test mode
-- already drives it), and it re-fires the switch with useRealDataProvider = true, so
-- every container -- ours and Blizzard's -- returns to the real source. No rebuild,
-- no teardown, no button pools recreated. The restore is just the real-switch branch.
--
-- THE TRADE: this is GLOBAL. Blizzard's own Edit Mode preview loses its sample
-- auras, so their buff frame and cooldown manager show your REAL auras while you
-- position them. That is the same class of trade DF test mode already makes in the
-- other direction, and the alternative is our own rows flashing.
--
-- ORDER, and why each step is where it is:
--   1. PARK synchronously, inside this dispatch. AURA_DATA_PROVIDER_SWITCH is a
--      SYNCHRONOUS event, so nothing is drawn between the containers' handler and
--      ours whichever order they run in -- parking here means the sample icons are
--      never painted at all.
--   2. RESET one frame later, never inline. An inline reset would nest a dispatch
--      inside this one, and any container the OUTER fake dispatch had not yet
--      visited would receive fake AFTER our reset and be stranded on the sample
--      source. A frame later the outer dispatch has finished and they all flip
--      together.
--   3. Only if the reset is unavailable or fails, fall back to REBIRTH: a container
--      built after a switch never receives it and useEditModeSource initialises
--      false, so a fresh container is on the real source by construction (probe 33's
--      born-deaf finding, which test mode's ordering already depends on).
--
-- DF's own test mode (P5) sets _ownsProviderSwitch around its switches so its
-- curated preview is exempt from all of this.

    -- container when our reset ran, that container takes fake AFTER the reset and sits
    -- on the sample source until Edit Mode closes. Measured as not happening on 68914,
    -- but that rests on an undocumented dispatch order, and this ships to configurations
    -- we will never test.
    --
    -- The sweep removes the need to reason about order at all: bounce the provider
    -- fake→real BACK TO BACK in one frame. Every container hears both, in that order,
    -- whatever order it is visited in, and ends on the real source. Nothing paints
    -- between two consecutive Lua statements.
    --
    -- It is near-free: UpdateAllAuras is MarkDirty(FullAuraRebuild), a bit-set, and
    -- ProcessDirtyFlags runs once on the next OnUpdate — so two marks in one frame
    -- produce ONE reparse, the same one the reset already scheduled.
    --
    -- ☠ THE DANGEROUS HALF: if Switch succeeds and Reset does not, the whole GAME is
    -- left on the fake provider — every aura display, ours and Blizzard's, showing
    -- sample icons. So Reset is retried hard, and as a last resort re-armed on a timer.

-- SLOT OWNER — one shared container per unit frame  (collapse S1)
-- ============================================================
-- ☠ ADDITIVE AND UNUSED. Nothing calls this yet; S2 moves the Aura Designer's placed
-- indicators onto it. Landing it alone keeps the diff reviewable and testable.
--
-- WHY. Every AD indicator sets singleSlot, so today each one gets a WHOLE AuraContainer
-- holding exactly ONE AddAuraSlot = one button. Measured across the 18 Create call sites
-- that is ~130 containers per unit frame worst case, ~5,200 in a 40-man, uncapped -- an
-- order of magnitude above what a fixed, enumerated set of slots would cost. WoW never
-- frees a frame and teardown cannot release buttons (RemoveAllAuraFrames does not exist
-- -- zero hits at 69111), so every structural edit strands the lot for the session.
--
-- One container per unit frame, one slot per indicator, instead.
--
-- ☠ WHY A NEW SLOT PER STRUCTURE, NOT A MUTATED ONE. A slot's regions are built in its
-- initializeFrame, which is frozen at AddAuraSlot and only ever runs at button creation.
-- So a structural change cannot mutate a slot -- it declares a NEW one (keyed by the
-- consumer's struct sig) and PARKS the old. That costs ONE button where today it costs a
-- container plus a button, and revisiting an earlier structure re-adopts the parked slot
-- by key. Declare-a-new-variant-and-park-the-old is the standard shape for this under an
-- add-only topology; there is no other correct one.
--
-- ☠ PARKING IS THE WHOLE MECHANISM, and it is why this could not be built before now.
-- AddAuraSlot is add-only -- Blizzard's ClearAuraGroups is "intentionally not exposed via
-- the inbound interface" because pooled frames would become irrecoverable -- and slots
-- have no maxFrameCount. That SetAuraSlotFilterString(key, "") empties a slot is not
-- determinable from the Lua source -- AuraUtil.IsValidFilterString("") returns true
-- because every component is skipped, but what the engine does with an empty predicate is
-- invisible. Proved in game with /alpark on 2026-08-05: it matches nothing (it does NOT
-- fall back to a default), and a bare re-Set restores it live.
--
-- ★ Z-ORDER: the dfLevelHost. Sharing a container means sharing its frame level, but AD
-- indicators need independent layering. Writing the level on the slot BUTTON is legal
-- only inside initializeFrame (pre-seal), which would freeze it permanently. So each slot
-- gets a DF-owned child frame between the button and our regions:
--     slot button (sealed, never re-levelled)  ->  dfLevelHost (ours, levelled LIVE)
-- Regions must stay DESCENDANTS of the button (ValidateInboundScriptObject errors
-- otherwise) and an interposed child frame satisfies that while staying levellable.
--
-- ⚠ Not handled in S1, by design: the identity gate (per-owner now, not per-handle),
-- test-mode frames (refused outright -- the preview declares its own topology), and
-- consumer styling, which stays with the caller via GetButton/GetLevelHost.

local SlotHandle = {}
SlotHandle.__index = SlotHandle

-- Every slot's regions hang off this, so the consumer can re-level live without ever
-- touching the sealed button. Created inside initializeFrame -- the only window in which
-- a tainted write to an aura button is legal.
-- ☠ POSITION IS THE CONSUMER'S, NOT THE FLOW'S. Slots take no part in dynamic layout
-- ("they do not take part in dynamic layout and must be manually anchored"), and with a
-- SHARED container there is no longer a per-indicator container whose own anchoring did
-- this job. Without it every slot lands on the shared container's corner, stacked on top
-- of one another -- which reads as "an indicator stopped rendering" when it is really
-- underneath its neighbour.
--
-- Applied at creation AND on every restyle: anchor/offset/scale are cosmetic (a drag
-- updates them live today), so freezing them at creation would be a regression.
-- ⚠ pcall'd: this is a tainted write to a button that carries
-- DenyTaintedAccessWhenAurasAreSecret, so a live re-anchor can be refused while auras are
-- secret. It re-applies on the next unrestricted restyle, which is the same contract
-- Handle:ApplyStyle already lives under.

-- ★ LEVEL host AND ALPHA host. styleButton_regions parents every region it creates onto
-- this frame (see the `host` local at its top), which is what lets a slot take a tainted
-- SetAlpha: the button refuses one, a DF-owned child frame does not.
--
-- ☠ THE EXPLICIT SetFrameLevel IS NOT COSMETIC — WITHOUT IT EVERY SLOT SHIFTS A LEVEL.
-- A new child frame defaults to its parent's level + 1. Interposing this host would
-- therefore push all of a slot's content up one level relative to everything else on the
-- frame, and AD levels are ABSOLUTE (a row is 9 levels thick — derive it from
-- DF.AuraButtonLevels, never from a number copied into prose like this one was)
-- — a uniform +1 walks a slot's content into the next band. Pinning the host to the
-- BUTTON's own level keeps every offset below it arithmetically identical to when the
-- regions hung off the button directly: makeHolder(host, n) resolves to the same level
-- makeHolder(button, n) did, and dfCD lands at button+1 exactly as before. Nothing is
-- left on the button to compete for draw order, so relative ordering is preserved whole.
-- ⚠ CALL AFTER ANY SetFrameLevel ON THE BUTTON. The host tracks the button's level, so
-- pinning it while the button is still at its default and only then applying
-- config.frameLevelOffset would strand the host — and every region on it — a band below
-- where the consumer asked the slot to sit. Idempotent, so calling it twice is free.

-- ★ THE LEGAL FADE TARGET FOR EVERY SLOT-BACKED INDICATOR ON THIS FRAME.

-- and therefore forbidden to tainted code on 12.1 — proven in the field, where even a bare
-- GetDebugName() on it is refused, not just the alpha setters. So per-indicator alpha on a
-- shared slot cannot be written at all.
--
-- ensureOwner already interposes a plain DF-created Frame between the unit frame and the
-- container (`anchor`), purely so the container has something to SetAllPoints to. That frame
-- is ours, lives above the whole aura hierarchy, and alpha multiplies down through the
-- container to every button and region inside it — so fading it fades every slot-backed
-- indicator on the frame with ONE legal write.
--
-- ⚠ Deliberately frame-wide, not per-indicator. Out-of-range is a property of the UNIT, so
-- every indicator on it fades together anyway; there is nothing to lose by sharing the write.
-- What this canNOT do is per-indicator BASE alpha (the AD Alpha slider) — that needs the
-- per-button host, which is unwritable. That capability is already gone for slot-backed
-- indicators regardless of this; fading here neither restores nor worsens it.

--     again on ApplyStyle. ☠ This is the seam that makes the collapse possible at all --

--
-- A per-indicator CONTAINER handle answers this with its own plain anchor frame
-- (Handle.frame, created by AuraContainer:Create), which is DF-owned and therefore a
-- legal write target from tainted code. A collapsed slot answers with dfLevelHost, the
-- DF-owned frame interposed between the button and every region styleButton_regions
-- creates. Fading it fades the whole slot, because nothing renders outside it.
--
-- The button itself is NOT a substitute. It carries DenyTaintedAccessWhenAurasAreSecret,
-- so any method call on it from a tainted path is refused the moment auras go secret --
-- field-confirmed as 43 errors from the out-of-range fade:
--     calling 'SetAlphaFromBoolean' on bad self (Attempt to access forbidden object
--     from code tainted by an AddOn)
-- SlotHandle:GetFrame returns the button on purpose (identity, and the OOR fade's old
-- `h:GetFrame()` probe), so consumers MUST ask for the alpha host separately rather than
-- assuming the two are the same object.
--
-- ★ WHY A CHILD FRAME IS WRITABLE WHERE THE BUTTON IS NOT, from the 12.1 source:
-- the restriction is applied by ApplyAccessRestrictions(auraFrame, ...) as a single
-- AddAccessRestrictions call on the BUTTON ALONE. Unlike forbidden aspects -- which
-- ValidateInboundScriptObject's own comment says "propagate through parent/child
-- hierarchies" -- access restrictions do not descend. Blizzard's setters still accept
-- our regions from one level deeper because IsDescendantOf allows "a direct child or
-- indirect descendent of owner".
--
-- ⚠ Still nil if host creation failed (pcall'd, pre-seal): consumers skip rather than
-- reach for the button, which is the behaviour that stopped the error storm.

-- ☠ THE IDENTITY GATE, WHICH THIS PATH HAD NONE OF. Every Aura Designer placed config
-- carries candidateFilters.includeSpellIDs, which is precisely what makes a filter
-- vulnerable -- so on a cross-faction arena opponent, or a party member in a different
-- instance or phase, includeSpellIDs FAILS OPEN engine-side and every AD indicator lights
-- for every aura on the target. That is the same class as the bugs the Handle gate was
-- written to fix, and migrating the consumers onto slots quietly bypassed it: SlotHandle
-- had no gate, no vulnerability flags, and was not in AuraContainer._handles, so
-- IdentityGateSweep never visited it.
--
-- Verdict logic is deliberately identical to Handle:_applyIdentityGate -- fail-open on
-- UnitCanAssist (hide only on a definite false), fail-safe on UnitIsVisible -- because
-- two gates that disagree are worse than one. What differs is the ACTUATION: a Handle
-- hides its frame, a slot has no frame of its own, so it parks. Parking is already the
-- right primitive (an empty filter string matches nothing, proven in game).
-- Slot-side twin of Handle:_noteGateRecovery — same edge, same reason (read that
-- header for the cinematic/UNIT_FACTION mechanism). The ACTUATION differs, as it does
-- for the gate itself: a slot has no backend to bounce.
--
-- ☠ AND IT IS THE CANDIDATES THAT MUST BE RE-PUSHED, NOT THE FILTER STRING.
-- `includeSpellIDs` is a CANDIDATE filter, not part of the filter string — so the
-- narrowing the fail-open skipped does not live in what _pushFilter sends, and
-- re-pushing an unchanged string need not reparse at all. First cut of this fix did
-- exactly that and one placed AD indicator kept rendering open (Krathe, in game);
-- the buff bars were fixed because the Handle path bounces the whole backend.
-- SetAuraSlotCandidateFilters has NO engine-side equality check — every call clears
-- the slot's candidates and reparses — which is precisely the bounce wanted here.
--
-- For a slot the gate DID hide, the transition below already re-pushes the string, so
-- this edge is what covers the case the gate never hides at all: your own frame.
-- CINEMATIC LATCH, slot half (see cineWatch at the bottom of the file). A slot has
-- no frame of its own, so the latch actuates the way the slot gate does: through
-- _pushFilter, where an empty string matches nothing (proven in game). Same failure
-- contract as Park/Restore -- a refused CLEAR would otherwise leave the slot dark
-- forever, so failure or lockdown queues the regen replay, which re-derives from
-- whatever the latch state is by drain time.

-- ============================================================
-- CINEMATIC LATCH — no flash of the fail-open parse
-- ============================================================
-- A cinematic flips UNIT_FACTION, the identity gate fails open, and the engine
-- keeps rendering that unfiltered parse until the recovery bounce re-parses it
-- (see Handle:_noteGateRecovery). The bounce is event-driven, so there was a
-- visible half-second of every-buff icons between the UI coming back and
-- UNIT_FACTION reaching us. The delay is upstream — Blizzard's own event timing
-- plus one parse tick; other addons report the identical residue — so the only
-- lever left is not SHOWING the frames until the re-parse has happened.
--
-- Shape: START latches every vulnerable handle/slot hidden (both events are
-- SynchronousEvent, so the latch lands before the first cinematic frame — and the
-- UI is hidden during playback anyway, so latching costs nothing visible). The
-- recovery edge clears each latch AFTER its bounce, so frames reappear already
-- re-parsed. STOP runs the gate sweep immediately (catching an assist restore
-- that raced ahead of our 50ms coalesce), then clears any handle whose assist
-- never dropped — its parse was never fail-open, nothing to wait for.
--
-- ☠ The fallback timer is NOT optional. Fail-safe direction here is SHOW (a
-- wrongly-hidden row is worse than one garbage frame — the gate's own rule), so
-- whatever is still latched 3s after STOP shows regardless, which degrades to
-- exactly the pre-latch behaviour and never below it. This is also what bounds
-- the mid-combat case, where the slot pushes defer to the regen replay.
--
-- ⚠ Accepted gap: a handle CREATED during a cinematic misses the START arm and
-- can still flash. Rebuilding mid-cinematic is rare enough that wiring
-- InCinematic() into the build path is not worth the coupling.

-- ============================================================
-- TEST MODE: the dispel type a frame's debuff window actually contains
-- ============================================================
-- ☠ THE OVERLAY MUST NAME A DEBUFF THAT IS ON THE FRAME. The frame overlay used to take
-- its type from a hardcoded frame-index pattern in the test data ("i % 5 == 1 -> Magic")
-- while the debuff ICONS came from the curated pool — two sources that were never linked.
-- They agreed by accident while every frame drew pool entries 1-2 (always Magic + Poison),
-- and the per-frame rotation broke the coincidence: a unit showed a Poison overlay with
-- three debuffs, none of them Poison (Krathe, 2026-08-06).
--
-- Reuses testPoolOffset — the SAME function the painter uses to choose entries — rather
-- than recomputing the window here, so the two cannot drift apart. That is the whole
-- point of this living in this file instead of in TestMode.lua.
--
-- Returns the first dispellable type in the unit's window, or nil when the window holds
-- none (which is how the pool's untyped entries set how often an overlay appears at all).
-- ⚠ DISPEL COLOURS THAT VANISH INTO A CLASS COLOUR. The overlay tints the whole frame,
-- so a type whose colour matches the unit's class bar reads as one flat wash — Krathe on
-- Magic (blue) landing on a MAGE (blue): "the blue overlay and class and icon clash."
-- Preview-only cosmetics: the pairing is legal and happens constantly in live play, it
-- just makes a poor demonstration of the feature. Extend when another pair reads badly.

    -- never be chosen — Krathe saw only Magic and Curse, because Disease (slot 2) and
    -- Poison (slot 4) were always the second entry of their pair.
    -- Any entry in the window is on the frame, so any of them is a valid answer; pick by
    -- unit so the choice varies frame to frame. Measured at count 2 over party + a full
    -- raid this reaches all five types (Curse 8, Magic 5, Poison 6, Disease 4, Bleed 4);
    -- the Curse skew is the pool's own — it is the one type appearing twice (slots 3
    -- and 8), every other type appears once.
    -- ⚠ ONLY THE COUNT-2 SPREAD IS TUNED. At count 5 the pool splits into just two
    -- windows (1-5 and 6-10), so the reachable palette collapses to Bleed/Curse/Magic and
