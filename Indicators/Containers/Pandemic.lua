-- ============================================================
-- DF.Pandemic — the refresh-window reveal (12.1.0 PTR 8, build 69111)
-- ============================================================
-- Turns a "pandemic*" config block into a style.pandemic spec that the AuraContainer
-- engine hands to CustomAuraButton:AddPandemicRegion. The engine stamps
-- Enum.SecretAspect.Shown on the registered object and drives SetShown itself from its
-- own window maths, so this is attach-and-inherit exactly like SetIcon: we build the art,
-- the game decides when it is visible, and nothing here reads an aura.
--
-- WHAT THE WINDOW IS. Blizzard computes it (Blizzard_CustomAuraButton.lua:612):
--     carriedOverToNewCast = GetRefreshExtendedDuration(u,id) - GetAuraBaseDuration(u,id)
--     window exists when carriedOverToNewCast > 0
--     start = expirationTime - carriedOverToNewCast ;  end = expirationTime
-- i.e. it lights exactly while a refresh would clip NOTHING. In practice that is the last
-- 30% of the base duration, but it is the GAME's number per spell, not ours — there is
-- deliberately no threshold control anywhere in this feature.
--
-- ⚠ MANY AURAS HAVE NO WINDOW AT ALL, and that is not a bug. Only a refreshable
-- duration has one. Charge-based auras (Prayer of Mending), fixed-duration procs, food,
-- flasks and anything you did not cast all return nil and stay dark forever. Confirmed in
-- game 2026-08-05 — a cue that never lights on a given spell is the feature working.
--
-- ☠ ADD, NEVER REPLACE. This does NOT supersede DF.Expiration, and the two are meant to
-- run together:
--   * expiry alert  = "about to fall off" — a USER threshold, any aura, zero per-frame cost,
--                     and the only one that can walk a colour ramp.
--   * pandemic      = "right moment to refresh" — the game's window, refreshable auras only,
--                     a boolean show/hide with no ramp, and a per-frame OnUpdate on the
--                     button while a window is open.
-- A 30s HoT enters its refresh window with ~9s left, which no sensible expiry threshold
-- would catch. They overlap in TIME on purpose; the editor only warns about SPACE.
--
-- ★ TWO TYPES, BORDER AND TINT. Custom Text and Glyph were built and then dropped
-- (Krathe, 2026-08-05): a boolean "now" cue wants to read at a glance from the edge of
-- vision, which is what a ring or a wash does and what a glyph competes with the icon to
-- do. Keeping two also means every control on the panel applies to both, so nothing hides.
--
-- ★ THE BORDER IS A REAL DF.Border. Not a fixed-weight TGA — the full house toolkit
-- (style, thickness, inset, offsets, colour, gradient, shadow), keyed exactly like every
-- other DF border so CreateBorderControls drives it with no special case. See BuildSpec
-- for why this is registered as a FRAME rather than as its four edge textures.
--
-- CONTRACT:
--   cfg     the settings table holding the keys (the AD indicator record, or DF.db[mode]).
--   prefix  "" / nil for the Aura Designer (bare `pandemicEnabled`), or a row prefix
--           ("buff", "debuff") for the flat profile table (`buffPandemicEnabled`).

-- ANIMATION.
--
-- ☠ WHY NOT DF.Border's ANIMATION SET (Wipe / Ripple / Segment Reveal / Sides / Corners /
-- DF Dash / Proc). Every one of them rides Border.lua's single shared OnUpdate driver,
-- which calls back per frame into tainted Lua and writes SetVertexColor / SetPoint / Hide
-- on the border's pieces. On a container button child that errors on every frame while
-- auras are secret — which is exactly the content this feature exists for. That is why
-- animation is stripped unconditionally from every container border, and it is not
-- something the working flash changes.
--
-- ★ WHAT DOES WORK: a native AnimationGroup, built and :Play()ed ONCE inside
-- initializeFrame (secure context) and then run entirely C-side — zero Lua per frame, and
-- nothing tainted touching the button after init.
--
-- ☠ ...but ONLY an Alpha animation. Scale was tried and does NOT run on the registered
-- holder (in game, 2026-08-05: FLASH pulsed, a Scale-based PULSE and a combined BREATHE
-- did nothing at all). The holder carries SecretAspect.Shown plus the forbidden aspects
-- AddPandemicRegion stamps on it, and a scale transform evidently does not survive that
-- where an alpha one does. Not worth pushing further: Blizzard have said pandemic
-- animation is being looked at for 12.1.5, so anything clever built here now is likely to
-- be replaced by something supported. ⚠ Re-test Scale on a later build before assuming it
-- is permanently dead — this is an empirical result, not a documented rule.
--
-- CREATION-FROZEN, hence part of StructSig: the group's animation and its duration are
-- baked when it is built, and reaching back in later would be a tainted write to a
-- forbidden child. So the toggle AND the speed both rebuild the slot.

-- The style.pandemic block, or nil when off (which includes an unsupported client —

--
-- ☠ BOTH TYPES REGISTER A FRAME, never a texture. Confirmed in game 2026-08-05:
-- `Frame:IsObjectType("Region")` is true, so AddPandemicRegion accepts one. That matters
-- for BORDER specifically: DF.Border's applyTexPieces calls Show() on every edge piece on
-- every Apply, so registering the PIECES would hand their Shown aspect to the engine and
-- turn DF.Border's own routine writes into forbidden writes on a button child. Registering
-- the holder frame instead leaves DF.Border in full control of everything inside it, and
-- gives the flash animation a frame to live on. TINT uses the same shape for one code path.
--
-- ctx carries what a border spec needs but the config cannot know: the slot's configured
-- pixel size (DF_DASH lays its dashes out from it — the button's real rect is SECRET) and
-- the container's render scale.

    --   TINT   — BELOW the duration text, the stack count, the dispel ring and
    --            DF.Border, but above the icon art and the cooldown swipe. A wash covers
    --            the whole button, so at the top it washed over the timer and the stack
